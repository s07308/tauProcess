Description: We propose a clinically meaningful measure of effect based on Kendall's tau
  with censored data to accomodate the requirements from addendum to ICH E9 highlighting
  the interpretability of estimand. The corresponding inference procedure is also provided.
  The plot of tau process is an intuitive graphical tool to monitor the evolution of treatment effect.
